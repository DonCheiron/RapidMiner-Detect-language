# RapidMiner-Detect-language
The aim is to optimally go through thousands of files and obtain the language, accuracy and later sentiment and subjectivity of the messages.

The file contains the process I was using to detect the language in what the text was written(EN/FR/NL), so that later I can perform sentiment analysis for that specific language.

Then I will compare the accuracy results for non-english messages with the process of first translating the messages in English and then to perform the sentiment and subjectivity analyses afterwards.
